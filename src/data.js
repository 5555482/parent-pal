    steps: [
      "1. When a child is too upset to cooperate, go back to Acknowledging Feelings “You don’t even want to think about visiting your friend another time. You were looking forward to going today!” Make sure your tone of voice matches the emotion  “That’s so disappointing!” Try a grunt instead of words  “UGH!” “Mmph!” Put your child’s thoughts into words  “Stupid Legos! They should stick together and stay together!” Tell the story of what happened  “You worked for a long time on that spaceship. You used blue bricks for the base, and red bricks for the lights, and it was almost ready to launch! All it needed was the fins on the rockets. …” ",
      "2. Give your child Time to Recover (and give yourself a break!) “I can see how sad you are. I’ll be in the kitchen making dinner. Come join me when you’re ready.” ",
      "3. Help a child climb out of the pit of despair by Acknowledging Feelings, Giving Information, and Offering Choices “Oh no, the skin got ripped! That hurts! Good thing skin knows how to repair itself. It’s getting busy right now growing more skin cells to cover that poor knee and make it as good as new. How many days do you think it will take? What kind of Band-Aid should we cover it with?” ",
      "4. Take Action and stick to your values; if you regularly cave in to whining and complaints, the tools won’t work “You wish we could have candy for breakfast! I’m putting it out of sight. The choices are cereal or eggs.” ",
      "5. Check on “The Basics” Is your child lacking food or sleep, or sleep, or feeling overwhelmed? Is your child developmentally ready to do what you’re expecting?"
